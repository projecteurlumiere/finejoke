          Finejoke is a <strong>free</strong> online game, where players come up with funny jokes. 
          Most laughable jokes get most points.        
        rules: And how do I play?
        rules_description_html: >
          Finejoke is similar to <em>Cards Against Humanity</em> and to <em>Quiplash</em> from <em>The Jackbox Party Pack</em>. 
          The main difference is that Finejoke players are tasked to think out jokes completely on their <strong>own</strong>.
        setup_step: "One player composes a joke's setup;"
        punchline_step: "Then the rest of the players think out funny punchlines to the setup;"
        vote_step: When the jokes are ready, a vote takes place to choose the funniest one. One vote equals one point.
        additional_rules: >
          Games may have additional rules. 
          You can find them by clicking on the big question mark button on the relevant game's page.
        anything_else: Anything else?

          Sure! 
          If you sign up, you will be able to use <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> features: 
          ChatGPT can help you create an amusing setup entry or come up with some ridiculous punchlines. 
          Moreover, AI can take a role of a virtual host in your game commenting the game live.
          On the contrary, you may opt out of using AI and play private games with your friends. 
          This way, none of your precious jokes will end up saved or sent elsewhere.
